TM-Corpus
=========

This package is additional to the TM (Topic Maps) suite on CPAN.  It
enriches a topic map instance with a document corpus. Content can be
retrieved from the topic map and/or can be harvested from the Internet
(for external references). Such a combo (map + document) can exist
also in persistent form, just to avoid the constant downloading of
resources.

As example application I have packaged a Plucene based fulltext query
trait. If you attach it to a corpus, it becomes queryable.
