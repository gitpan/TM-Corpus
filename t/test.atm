in (definition): The Semantic Web is the abstract representation of\
	data on the World Wide Web, based on the RDF standards and other\
	standards to be defined. It is being developed by the W3C, in\
	collaboration with a large number of researchers and industrial\
	partners.
in (quote): The Semantic Web is an extension of the current web in\
	which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling\
	computers and people to work in cooperation.

problem: syntactic-web
solution: semantic-web

syntactic-web (technology)
bn: Syntactic Web
in: myriads of web sites -- only for "humans" and screen-scrapers
in (problem): information hidden in different formats -- different languages -- in pictures
in (problem): not following a processable vocabulary -- domain-specific terminology -- only humans can interpret that
oc (article): http://www.idealliance.org/papers/xml2001/papers/html/03-01-04.html
in (problem): Google (and other SEs) have to index full-text, a lot! -- Google does not reach all of the DB content -- how can Google know what is important? -- \
   get "information" at best, not knowledge
in: "12345678 has passed an XML course conducted by Robert" -- implicit knowledge: 12345678 is a student number, \
   number belongs to X, X is a person, Robert is a person, X knows Robert, X knows XML, X knows XPath
in (conclusion): much information, much confusion -- much confusion, little knowledge

If you've been following Jon Udell's recent columns, you'll be
aware of the evolutionary development of the markup he uses on
his own web site. This month, Udell analyzes his progress and
suggests that the real route the Semantic Web will take will be
similar to that of real language itself: something that grows as
we talk, listen, and imitate.

<http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/09/17/udell.html>

Kendall's put together a couple of reports for us from the
conference.  The first is entitled "Commercializing the Semantic
Web" and focuses on how semantic web technologies are and will be
brought into marketable products.  Kendall focuses particularly
on a company called Network Inference, which has achieved this
goal, and learned some valuable lessons.

<http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/10/22/iswc.html>

The second ISWC report covers the world of "rules."  Rules are
part of Tim Berners-Lee's "layer cake" of semantic web technology,
and are necessary for deducing new facts from existing ones, or
firing actions.  As well as surveying the state of the rules world,
Kendall ponders how the academic community can connect with the
free software development world in order to make the semantic web
as successful as the original web.

<http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/10/23/iswc.html>




The Semantic Web gets real
Eric Knorr, ZDNet

Put a semantic "wrapper" around Web services, and you could potentially reduce the complexity of
what needs to be specified in protocols and XML schema.

http://www.zdnet.com.au/newstech/communications/story/0,2000024993,20270718,00.htm




Finally, as usual we have our regular dose of news from the XML
community in the XML-Deviant column.  One oft-discussed topic is
whether the future of the Web belongs to Web services or to the
Semantic Web.  Kendall Clark discovers that a new project, DAML-S, sets
out to unify the two, and indeed could reach further into distributed
computing in general.

Read "The True Meaning of Service" at
http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/07/17/daml-s.html




In the third and final part of our look at the DARPA Agent Markup
Language, an important part of developing Semantic Web technology,
Roxane Ouellet provides us with a handy reference to the classes
and properties of RDF, RDF Schema and DAML.  If you like your web
semantic, be sure to bookmark
<http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/05/01/damlref.html>.


Staying on the Semantic Web theme, Kendall Clark examines the W3C's
Web Ontology Working Group in this week's XML Deviant column.  The
WebOnt WG is developing a language that will be the successor to
DAML, intended for use in describing ontologies.  Kendall explains
the mission of WebOnt and comments on their progress so far at
<http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/05/01/webont.html>.



XML.com's main feature this week focuses on DAML, a modeling
language built on RDF.  DAML allows the sort of sophisticated
data modeling that is required for the vision of the
machine-processable Semantic Web to be realized.  Follow the
first part of Uche Ogbuji's Introduction to DAML at
<http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/01/30/daml1.html>.

We have been playing a bit with your GEDCOM example.
We actually rewrote it in N3 and the relations are at
http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/gedcom-relations.n3
To have a practical example, some facts are at
http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/gedcom-facts.n3
We did all kinds of queries such as at
http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/gedcom-query.n3
and found all kinds of proofs such as at
http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/gedcom-relations.n3
We had to fix (actually simplify) cycle detection.
Recursions and mutual references seem to work ...
Maybe the proofs can give an idea about possible
simplifications of the relations ...
